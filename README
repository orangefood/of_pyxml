oxml is a very naive XML parser package.  oxml will try to parse even very badly formatted
XML and HTML.  The main effort is that the parsing should be robust to bad markup.  If you are
going to parse nice XML then this is not the parser for you.  However if you need to scrape a bit
of information of an HTML page whose markup is less than standard then oxml may provide a solution.

Like standard XML parsers oxml provides two parser modes, an event mode (think SAX) and a document mode
(think DOM).  The event mode parser is called oxml.sxml and is of reasonable quality that I am willing to 
distribute it and use it in other codes I publish.  The document mode parser is called oxml.dxml and
is experimental.  While it does a reasonable job on well-formed documents it struggles with poorly formed
documents of the kind found in wide distrobution on the world wide web.  The reason is that the code makes
some assumption about un matched tags and frankly those assumptions are right as frequently as they are wrong.
